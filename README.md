# Graduation-Project-Raytracing

Hi my name is Max and this is my half year graduation project for Breda University of Applied Sciences. As a graphics oriented project I've decided to focus on raytracing using Microsoft DXR.

NeelEngine project is a framework that functions as a wrapper around DirectX 12. 
ReflectionsDemo project contains a file called reflections_demo.cpp, which holds the main onLoad(), onUpdate(), and onRender() fucntions.

Do keep in mind that currently, this is far from being a finished project. No optimizations or cleanup has been performed yet since I'm mainly focused on exploring DXR and getting some raytracing effects working. However, optimizations and cleanup will occur in the near future.

Important: To run this project you need hardware that supports DXR!
