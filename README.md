# Graduation-Project-Raytracing

Hi my name is Max and this is my half year graduation project for Breda University of Applied Sciences. As a graphics oriented project I've decided to focus on raytracing using Microsoft DXR.

NeelEngine project is a framework that functions as a wrapper around DirectX 12. 
ReflectionsDemo project contains a file called reflections_demo.cpp, which holds the main onLoad(), onUpdate(), and onRender() fucntions.
